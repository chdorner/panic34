# panic34

My Zaphod ZMK firmware.

Forked from [petejohanson/zaphod-config](https://github.com/petejohanson/zaphod-config) and docs for updating the firmware are [here](https://docs.lpgala.xyz/docs/zaphod-build-guide/firmware/).
The firmware is still built via GitHub actions, so this repository is mirrored to GitHub at [chdorner/panic34](https://github.com/chdorner/panic34).
